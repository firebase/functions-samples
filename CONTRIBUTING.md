## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the Firebase functions-samples project, we
pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating
documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any
other activities.

Communication through any of Firebase's channels (GitHub, StackOverflow,
Twitter, etc.) must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks,
trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional
conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project
regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age,
race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing
to the project to do the same.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of
this project may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking
accounts as deemed appropriate.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other
concerns, please drop us a line at
[Firebase support](https://firebase.google.com/support).

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

- To report specific problems with the samples in this repository, file an
  [issue](#issue).
- If you have questions about a sample in this repository, try opening a
  [discussion](https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/discussions).
- For general Cloud Functions for Firebase questions, please ask on
  [StackOverflow][stackoverflow] and use the `firebase` tag.
- If you have a problem specific to your Firebase project, or would like to
  report an issue with Firebase itself, contact
  [Firebase support](https://firebase.google.com/support).

## <a name="issue"></a> Found an Issue?

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can
help us by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better,
you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

See [below](#submit) for some guidelines.

## <a name="submit"></a> Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an Issue

Before you submit your issue search the archive in case your question was
already answered.

Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features by not reporting duplicate issues.

The more information you can provide in an issue, the faster we can resolve it.
Issues that don't make an attempt to follow the issue template will likely be
closed.

### New samples

Given the maintenance cost of the large number of samples that are already in
this repository, we are unlikely to add new samples. However, if you have an
idea for a sample and would like to discuss it with others, take a look at the
["ideas" section of this repository's discussions](https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/discussions?discussions_q=category%3AIdeas).

Pull Requests that contain new samples will only be considered if they meet the
following criteria:

- Solve a common use-case for Cloud Functions for Firebase with minimal
  non-Firebase setup required
- Thoroughly documented
- Thoroughly tested
- Simple enough to be maintained alongside all other samples in the repository

If your Pull Request isn't accepted, consider hosting it in your own GitHub
repository, and adding it to our
[list of community-built extensions](./community.md)!

## <a name="cla"></a> Signing the CLA

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your
contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your
contributions as part of the project. Head over to
<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or
to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

Please sign our [Contributor License Agreement][google-cla] (CLA) before sending
pull requests. For any code changes to be accepted, the CLA must be signed. It's
a quick process, we promise!
