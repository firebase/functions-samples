# Test client for call-vertex-remote-config-server

## Introduction

This is a basic web app that calls the `callVertexWithRC` function. The
function uses values stored in Remote Config server templates with
the Firebase Admin SDK to dynamically update Vertex AI Gemini API
parameters. Access is controlled using Firebase App Check.

- [Read more about the Vertex AI Node.js Client library](https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/docs/reference/aiplatform/latest).

Important: Vertex AI and Cloud Functions require a billing account. Review
[Vertex AI pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing) and
[Firebase pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing) before running
this function. If you're new to Firebase and Google Cloud, check to see if
you're eligible for a
[$300 credit](https://firebase.google.com/support/faq#pricing-free-trial) and
a Free Trial Cloud Billing account.

## Get started

1.  Create a [Firebase project and register a web app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#create-firebase-project-and-app).
2.  [Create a ReCAPTCHA Enterprise key](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check/web/recaptcha-enterprise-provider#project-setup)
    in the same project.
3.  [Enable App Check](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check/web/recaptcha-enterprise-provider)
    in the Firebase console with the ReCAPTCHA Enterprise site key you created.
4.  Copy your Firebase project config and your ReCAPTCHA Enterprise site key
    into the appropriate places in `config.ts` in this directory.
5.  In this directory, run `npm install`.
6.  Set up and deploy the function as described in [../README.md](../README.md).
7.  In this directory, run `npm run dev` to run the client.

To run this app against the `callVertexWithRC` function running in the Firebase
emulator, ensure that `testMode`in `main.ts` is set to `true`. Before testing
with a deployed (i.e., not emulated) function, set `testMode` to `false`.

TIP: You can build the client and deploy to Firebase Hosting by running
`npm run build` from the `client` directory. Hosting deliverables are
generated and saved in `client/dist` and you can then deploy to
the emulator or Firebase Hosting from the parent directory. We recommend
deploying to the emulator first--you can use the following command to
deploy the function and web client simultaneously:

     firebase serve --only functions,hosting
