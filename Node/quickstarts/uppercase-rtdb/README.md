# Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions 2nd Gen Quickstart - Realtime Database

This quickstart demonstrates using **Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions** with **Firebase Realtime Database**.

## Introduction

This sample app does two things:

- Create messages in the Firebase Realtime Database using a simple HTTPS request which is handled by a v2 HTTPS function. Writing to the Realtime Database is done using the Firebase Admin SDK.
- When a message gets added in the Realtime Database, a v2 function triggers and automatically makes these messages all uppercase.

## Deploy and try out

To deploy and try out the sample:

- Create a Firebase project using the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
- Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the `functions` directory
- Deploy your project's code using `firebase deploy`
- Create a message by opening the querying the functions URL from your browser.

The function executes and redirects the browser to the Firebase console at the database location where the text string was stored. You should see your text value displayed in the console and in uppercase.
