Have a usage question about Functions?
======================================
We get lots of those and we love helping you, but the samples issue tracker is not the best place for them and they
will be closed. Here are some resources to get help:

- Go through the Contributor's Guide: https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
- Read the full user's guide: https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/

If the official documentation doesn't help, try asking through our officially supported channels:

- Firebase Google Group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/firebase-talk
- Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-cloud-functions+firebase

*Please avoid double posting across multiple channels!*

Think you found a bug?
=======================
Yeah, we're definitely not perfect! Please use the bug report template below and include a minimal
repro when opening the issue.

Have a request for a new sample?
================================
Great, we love hearing how we can improve our samples! Remove the template below and
provide an explanation of your sample request. Be as detailed as possible.
Note that it should cover a use case that isn't similar to our existing samples and
likely to be of broad use (i.e. not just a copy/paste solution to your specialized problem).
