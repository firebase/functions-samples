<h2><a name="General_overview"></a>General overview</h2>

<p>
This document describes how to build a Ghostscript executable from source
code.  There are four major steps to building Ghostscript:

<ol>
<li>Acquire the compressed archive files of source code for Ghostscript.
<li>Unpack the archive files into the Ghostscript directory.
<li>Configure the build to match your system and desired configuration options.
<li>Invoke "<code>make</code>" to build the software.
</ol>

<p>
The remainder of this document describes each of these steps in detail.
Note that some of this process is platform-dependent.  After building
Ghostscript you must then install it; for that, see the
<a href="Install.htm">installation instructions</a>.
<p>
Long term users of Ghostscript may notice the instructions for a number of
older systems have been removed from this document. There is no value judgment
implied in this, but recognition that the build system has changed considerably
in recent years, and several of these legacy systems are no longer easily
available to the development team. We will always consider contributions to
continue support for legacy systems.
<hr>

<h2><a name="Acquiring"></a>How to acquire the source code</h2>

<p>
Building Ghostscript requires the Ghostscript source code itself, and in 
some cases the source code for the third-party libraries that 
Ghostscript uses.

<p><a name="Authoritative_distribution_site"></a>
Official releases can be found under the AGPL license at

<blockquote>
<a href="http://ghostscript.com/download/"
class="offsite">http://ghostscript.com/download/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Ghostscript source code is packaged in gzip-compressed tar archives (*<code>.tar.gz</code>).
(Unlike earlier versions, Ghostscript packages are now one, complete archive, including font files
and third party library dependency sources).

<blockquote>
<code>ghostscript-</code>#.##<code>.tar.gz</code><br>
</blockquote>

<p>
("#.##" are version numbers.)
Software to decompress and extract both formats is available for almost
every platform for which Ghostscript is available -- including Unix, Linux, 
MS Windows, and  so on -- but it's up to you to locate that software.
See the section on <a
href="#Unpack">unpacking the source code</a>.

<h2><a name="Acquiring_git"></a>How to acquire the development source code</h2>
<p>
The Ghostscript team use <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> for version
control.
<p>
If you require a snapshot of the development code, the easiest way to get it
is to visit the web interface to our <code>git</code> repository:
<a href="http://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=summary">ghostpdl.git</a>
and click the &quot<code>snapshot</code>&quot link next to the specific commit
in which you are interested. After a short delay, that will download a complete
source tree for the given commit in a <code>gzipped</code> <code>tar</code>
archive.
<p>
If you require access to several commits, or wish to regularly access the
latest development code, you are better to clone the entire <code>git</code>
repository, using:
<blockquote>
<code>git clone git://git.ghostscript.com/ghostpdl.git</code>
</blockquote>
which will create a local, read-only repository.
<p>
Both the &quot<code>snapshot</code>&quot and the <code>git clone</code> methods
download the <code>Ghostscript</code> sources as part of the <code>GhostPDL</code>
source tree, which includes the <code>PCL/PXL</code> and <code>XPS</code>
interpreters also built on top of the <code>Ghostscript</code> graphics library.
<p>
The <code>configure</code> script discussed later in the document is created as
part of the <code>Ghostscript</code> release process, and as the source tree
retrieved from <code>git</code> is &quotpre-release&quot code, it does not
include a pre-made <code>configure</code> script. See <a href="#autogen_sh">autogen.sh</a>
<hr>

<h2><a name="Unpack"></a>How to unpack the source code</h2>

<p>
Unfortunately there are no generally accepted standards for how to package
source code into archives, so the instructions for unpacking Ghostscript are
longer than they should be.  We begin with a brief explanation of how to
extract the two kinds of archive files.

<h3><a name="Tarfiles"></a>How to unpack compressed tar files generally</h3>

<p>
Tar (<code>.tar</code>) files are the <em>de facto</em> standard for
archiving files on Unix (every Unix-like system has the <code>tar</code>
program), and programs to extract their contents are also widely available
for MS Windows, and most other environments. To economize on space and downloading
time, Ghostscript's tar files are compressed with GNU <code>gzip</code>, which
adds the suffix "<code>.gz</code>" to the file name, giving
"<code>.tar.gz</code>".

<p>
To unpack a compressed tar file <code>MyArchive.tar.gz</code> you
must both decompress it and extract the contents.  You can do this in two
steps, one to decompress the file and another to unpack it:

<blockquote>
<code>gzip -d MyArchive.tar.gz</code>
<br><code>tar -xf MyArchive.tar</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
or in a pipeline:

<blockquote>
<code>gzip -d -c MyArchive.tar.gz | tar -xf -</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
or, if you have a program like GNU <code>tar</code> that can handle
compressed tar files, with a single command:

<blockquote>
<code>tar -zxf MyArchive.tar.gz</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <code>tar</code> program automatically preserves directory structure
in extracting files.  The Ghostscript source archive puts all files under a
directory <code>ghostscript-</code>#.##, so using <code>tar</code> to unpack a
compressed archive should always properly create that directory, which we
will call the "ghostscript directory".  Make sure you're positioned in the
<b><em>parent</em></b> of the ghostscript directory <b><em>before</em></b> unpacking
the files.  If a subdirectory doesn't already exist, <code>tar</code>
creates it.

<p>
Some other programs -- under MS Windows, for instance -- can also unpack
compressed tar files, but they may not automatically preserve directory
structure nor even extract files into the current directory.  If you use
one of these, you must

<ul>
<li>set the program's options to "Use folder names" or the equivalent, and
<li>check that it is extracting files into the right place.
</ul>

<p>
As both <code>tar</code> and <code>gzip</code> formats are now well supported 
by several applications on MS Windows, we only supply the <code>tar.gz</code> archive. 

<blockquote>
<p>
<a href="http://www.winzip.com">
WinZip</a>
<p>
<a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">
7-zip</a>
<p>
<a href="http://www.info-zip.org/">
Info-ZIP</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
are respectively a commercial and two free applications which can decompress and extract
<code>.tar.gz</code> archives on MS Windows.

<h3><a name="Unpack_Ghostscript"></a>How to unpack Ghostscript itself</h3>

<p>
At this point you have <a href="#Acquiring">acquired the source code</a>
and are ready to unpack it according to the 
<a href=#Tarfiles">preceding guidelines</a>. To unpack the Ghostscript
source, make the <b><em>parent</em></b> of the (new)
gs directory the current directory.

<blockquote><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr>	<th align=left valign=top>2-step:
	<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<td><code>gzip -d ghostscript-</code>#.##<code>.tar.gz</code><br><code>tar -xf ghostscript-</code>#.##<code>.tar</code>

<tr><td>
<tr>	<th align=left valign=top>GNU <code>tar</code>:
	<td>&nbsp;
	<td><code>tar -zxf ghostscript-</code>#.##<code>.tar.gz</code>
</table></blockquote>

<p>
All the Ghostscript source files are now in subdirectories of the gs
directory.

<blockquote><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>

	<td>XPS interpreter C source code and makefiles
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>Supporting third party libraries will also be in their own sub-directories (e.g. <code>jpeg</code>, <code>freetype</code> and so on).

<h4>Luratech compressor libraries</h4>

<p>Ghostscript has optional support for the Luratech proprietary JBIG2 
and JPEG 2000 implementations. If you have the source code for these 
and wish the compile them into Ghostscript, the build system expects 
them to be in directories named <code>luratech/ldf_jb2</code> and
<code>luratech/lwf_jp2</code> in the top level gs source directory, alongside
the other third-party libraries. With the Luratech source directories in the
expected place, the build system will automatically include them.
<p>
If you have the Luratech code but wish to build without it, on "configure"
based builds you can achieve this by doing:
<br>
<blockquote>
<code>./configure --without-luratech</code>
</blockquote>
<p>
On Windows, you can achieve it by adding:
<br>
<blockquote>
<code>NO_LURATECH=1</code>
</blockquote>
to your nmake command line.
<p>
With either of these options, the build will fall back to the defaults for
both JBIG2 and JPEG2000 decoding.

<h2><a name="Bug_check"></a>How to check for post-release bug fixes</h2>

<p>
Bug information and fixes are tracked on Ghostscript Bugzilla.
For more information, please visit

<blockquote>
<a href="http://bugs.ghostscript.com">
http://bugs.ghostscript.com</a>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2><a name="Makefile_overview"></a>How to prepare the makefiles</h2>

<p>
The Ghostscript makefiles are very large and complex in order to deal with
the diverse requirements of all the different systems where they may be
used.

<p>
Ghostscript has an automatic configuration script. If you're on unix or
a system that supports unix shell scripts, this is the easiest option to use.
Simply type:

<blockquote>
<code>./configure</code>
</blockquote>

from the top level of the ghostscript source directory. It should configure
itself based on what's available on your system, warn you of any missing
dependencies, and generate a Makefile. At this point you can skip to the
section <a href="#Invoke_make">invoking make</a> below. Also, many common 
configuration options (like install location) can be set through options 
to the configure script.
<p>
Type '<tt>./configure --help</tt>' for a complete
listing. Note that the configuration option is only available with the 
unix .tar distributions of the source.

<p>
Note that if you're building Ghostscript from development source out of
a repository instead of from a released source package, you should run
'<tt>./autogen.sh</tt>' instead of <tt>./configure.</tt> This script 
takes all the same options that configure does.

<p>
If your system doesn't support the configure script or you don't wish to
use it, you can use the traditional ghostscript makefile system, editing
the options by hand to match your system as described below.
Fortunately, the only makefiles you're likely to want to change are
relatively small ones containing platform-specific information.

<blockquote><a name="Platform-specific_makefiles"></a><table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><th colspan=3 bgcolor="#CCCC00"><hr><font size="+1">Platform-specific makefiles</font><hr>
<tr>	<th align=left>Makefile
	<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<th align=left>Used for
<tr>	<td colspan=3><hr>
<tr>	<td><code>Makefile.in</code>
	<td>&nbsp;

<tr>	<td><code>base/unix-gcc.mak</code>
	<td>&nbsp;
	<td>Unix with gcc
<tr>	<td><code>base/unixansi.mak</code>
	<td>&nbsp;
	<td>Unix with ANSI C compilers other than gcc
<tr>	<td>&nbsp;
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
A number of platform indepdent makefiles in each of the core Ghostscript source directories.
Since these files can change from one Ghostscript version to another, sometimes
substantially, and since they all include documentation for the various
options, here we don't duplicate most of that documentation: we recommend
strongly that you review the entire makefile specific for your operating
system and compiler before building Ghostscript.

<h3>Building against the Luratech compression libraries</h3>

<p>
To compile Ghostscript against the proprietary Luratech JBIG2 and JPEG 
2000 implementations, simply ensure that the <code>luratech/ldf_jb2</code> and
<code>luratech/lwf_jp2</code> containing the Luratech code exist in the top level
gs source directory, and (re-)run <code>configure</code> (ensuring to <code>make clean</code> before
re-running make). The configure
script will detect the presence of the directories, and apply the appropriate
settings in the Makefile.
<p>
If you have the Luratech directories in place, but want Ghostscript built
without it, you can run configure with the <code>--without-luratech</code> option, and
the script will behave as if the directories did not exist.
 
<h3><a name="Preparing_makefiles"></a>Changes for your environment</h3>

<p>
Assuming you have opted not to use the <code>configure</code> script or
the default Microsoft Visual Studio bulid, you must
edit the platform-specific makefile to change any of these:

<ul>
<li>The name of the makefile itself (<code>MAKEFILE</code> macro)
<li>The locations to install Ghostscript files (<code>prefix</code> etc.)
<li>The default search paths for the initialization and font files
(<code>GS_LIB_DEFAULT</code> macro)
<li>The debugging options (<code>DEBUG</code> and <code>TDEBUG</code>
macros)
<li>Which optional features to include (<code>FEATURE_DEVS</code>)
<li>Which device drivers to include (<code>DEVICE_DEVS</code> and
<code>DEVICE_DEVS</code>{<em>1--20</em>} macros)
<li>Default resolution parameters for some printer drivers
(<code>devs.mak</code> or <code>contrib.mak</code>, whichever defines
the driver)

</ul>
<p> In general these will be set to commonly sensible values already, but
may not be ideal for your specific case.

<p>
The <a href="#Platform-specific_makefiles">platform-specific makefiles</a>
include comments describing all these except the
<code>DEVICE_DEVS</code> options.  These are described in
<code>devs.mak</code> and <code>contrib.mak</code>, even though the
file that must be edited to select them is the <a
href="#Platform-specific_makefiles">platform-specific makefile</a>.

<p>
Some platform-specific options are described in the sections for individual
platforms.  See the "Options" section near the beginning of the relevant
makefile for more information.

<h3><a name="Features_and_devices"></a>Selecting features and devices</h3>

<p>
You may build Ghostscript with any of a variety of features and with any
subset of the available device drivers.  The complete list of features is
in a comment at the beginning of <code>gs.mak</code>, and the complete
list of drivers in comments at the beginning of <code>devs.mak</code>
and <code>contrib.mak</code>.  To find what devices a platform-specific
makefile selects to include in the executable, look in it for all lines of
the form

<blockquote>
<code>FEATURE_DEVS=</code><em>{list of features}</em><br>
<code>DEVICE_DEVS</code>*<code>=</code><em>{list of devices}</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
For example, if the makefile has

<blockquote><code>
FEATURE_DEVS=&#36;(PSD)level2.dev
</code></blockquote>

<p>
indicating that only the PostScript Level 2 facilities should be included,
you might make it

<blockquote><code>
FEATURE_DEVS=&#36;(PSD)level2.dev &#36;(PSD)pdf.dev
</code></blockquote>

<p>
to add the ability to interpret PDF files.  (In fact,
<code>FEATURE_DEVS</code> in the current Unix makefiles already includes
<code>&#36;(PSD)pdf.dev</code>.).

<p>
It is extremely important that FEATURE_DEVS is set correctly. Currently,
the default builds will include a complete feature set, and as such most
of those building Ghostscript will have no need to change it. Only those
working in heavily resource constrained environment will want to experiment,
and it is vital that the implications of such changes be understood, otherwise
Ghostscript may behave in unexpected or apparently incorrect ways, or may
even fail to build.

<p>
The Unix makefile also defines

<blockquote><code>
DEVICE_DEVS=&#36;(DD)x11.dev
</code></blockquote>

<p>
indicating that the X Windows driver should be included, but since
platform-specific makefiles as distributed normally include many of the
possible features and drivers, you will probably rather remove from the
makefile the features and drivers you don't want.  It does no harm to
include unneeded features and devices, but the resulting executable will be
larger than needed.

<p>
You may edit the <code>FEATURE_DEVS</code> line to select or omit any of
the features listed near the beginning of <code>gs.mak</code>, and the
<code>DEVICE_DEVS</code>* lines to select or omit any of the device
drivers listed near the beginning of <code>devs.mak</code> and
<code>contrib.mak</code>. GS_DEV_DEFAULT is a string containing whitespace
separate device names, and give the devices Ghostscript should attempt to use
(and the order) if no device is specified on the command line;
see the usage documentation for <a href="Use.htm#Output_device">how to
select an output device</a> at run time using the
<a href="Use.htm#DEVICE_switch"><code>-sDEVICE=</code></a> switch.  If
you can't fit all the devices on a single line, you may add lines defining

<blockquote>
<code>DEVICE_DEVS1=&#36;(DD)</code><em>{dev11}</em><code>.dev</code> ... <code>&#36;(DD)</code><em>{dev1n}</em><code>.dev</code>
<br><code>DEVICE_DEVS2=&#36;(DD)</code><em>{dev21}</em><code>.dev</code> ... <code>&#36;(DD)</code><em>{dev2n}</em><code>.dev</code>
</blockquote>

<p>
etc., up to <code>DEVICE_DEVS15</code>.  Don't use continuation lines --
on some platforms they don't work.

<p>
Note that if you want to include a driver named <em>xxx</em>, you must put
<code>&#36;(DD)</code><em>xxx</em><code>.dev</code> in
<code>DEVICE_DEVS</code>*.  Similarly, if you want to include a feature
related to the PostScript or PDF language interpreters (PostScript level
1 .. 3, or other language features such as the ability to read EPSF files or
TrueType font files), you must represent it as
<code>&#36;(PSD)</code><em>xxx</em><code>.dev</code>.

<h4><a name="Precompiled_data"></a>Precompiled run-time data</h4>

<p>
Ghostscript normally reads a number of external data files at run time:
initialization files containing PostScript code, fonts, and other resources
such as halftones. By changing options in the top-level makefile for the
platform, you can cause some of these files to be compiled into the
executable: this simplifies installation, improves
security, may reduce memory requirements, and may be essential if you are
planning on putting Ghostscript into ROM. Compiling these files into the executable
also means the executable is (largely) self-contained, meaning initialization
files, font files, resource files and ICC profile files are certain to be available
and accessible. In general, Ghostscript should initialize more quickly, and files
(especially PDF) files making heavy use of the built-in fonts will interpret more
quickly.
<p>
For those distributing Ghostscript binaries, compiling those files into the executable
has another implication, any site-specific customizations (such as font and CIDFont
substitutions) are slightly more complex to implement - see:
<blockquote>
<a href="Use.htm#Finding_files">How Ghostscript finds files</a>
</blockquote>
for how to influence where Ghostscript searches for files. Furthermore, if the files
Ghostscript uses are also required to be accessible by applications other than Ghostscript
(the mostly case for this would be font files and ICC profile files), having those files
compiled into Ghostscript maybe suboptimal, essentially require two copies of the file
data to be distributed (one set built into Ghostscript, and the other as &quotnormal&quot files
accessible outside of Ghostscript.

<p>
Compiling the initialization files (<code>Resource/Init/gs_init.ps</code>, etc.)
into the executable is the default. To disable this, change the <code>1</code> to
a <code>0</code> in the line

<blockquote><code>
COMPILE_INITS=1
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Or, if you use the <code>configure</code> based Unix-style build, you can disable
COMPILE_INITS by adding the option <code>--disable-compile-inits</code> to the invocation
of <code>configure</code>
<p>
Files are now compiled into the executable as a %rom% file system that can
be searched, opened, etc. as with the normal (%os%) file system. The data
is (mostly) compressed. Several of the initialisation files (those in <code>Resource/Init</code>)
are also converted to binary Postscript encoding, and &quot;merged&quot; into a single monolithic
file - this is done for both size and speed optimization. Files that are often customized for
individual installations (such as <code>Fontmap</code> and <code>cidfmap</code>) are not
merged into the single file and thus installation specific versions can be used.
<p>
The set of files built into the %rom% file system
is specified in the <code>psi/psromfs.mak</code> file. By default the set
of files built into the rom file system comprises all the resource files
Ghostscript requires to run successfully (all the files under <code>Resource</code>
directory, and those under the <code>iccprofiles</code> directory). Refer to the file
<code>base/mkromfs.c</code> for a description of the parameters that
control source and destination pathnames, file enumeration exclusion,
compression, etc.

<p>
Fonts normally are compiled into the executable using <code>mkromfs</code>
(above) from the Resource/Font/ directory.</a>. 

<p>
Similarly, Halftone resources can be compiled into the executable using
<code>mkromfs</code>, but also threshold-array halftones can be compiled
into the executable. See the "Compiled halftone" section of <code>int.mak</code>
for a sample makefile fragment, <code>genht.c</code> for the syntax of
halftone data files, and <code>lib/ht_ccsto.ps</code> for a sample data file.
 Note that even though the data files use PostScript syntax, compiled halftones
do not require the PostScript interpreter and may be used with the graphics
library alone.

<h3><a name="Makefile_setup"></a>Setting up "makefile"</h3>

<p>
After going through the steps just described to <a href="#Unpack">unpack
the
sources</a>, configure the build and make any desired
<a href="#Preparing_makefiles">changes to the
makefiles</a>.
As the final step in preparing to build Ghostscript you must usually 
associate the name "<code>makefile</code>" with the correct makefile 
for your environment so the <code>make</code> command can find it.  
See the section on your particular platform for how to do that if 
necessary.

<p>
On unix systems, <code>./configure</code> (or if checked out of git,
<code>./autogen.sh</code>) should create a <code>Makefile</code> which works
in most scenarios. Manual tampering and editing should rarely be needed
nor recommended.
<p>

<h3><a name="Invoke_make"></a>Invoking "make"</h3>

<p>
<b><em>Note:</em></b> on most platforms some of these simple instructions don't
quite work in one way or another. Read the section on your specific

<p>
<b><em>Note 2:</em></b> If you are attempting to build a statically linked
executable, you will probably need to add libraries to the linker options
(libraries that are normally pulled-in automatically by the dynamic linker).
These can be added at the make command line using the "EXTRALIBS=" option.
Unfortunately, the set of libraries that may be required varies greatly
depending on platform and configuration, so it is not practical to offer
a list here.

<h3><a name="Cross-compiling"></a>Cross-compiling</h3>
<p>
Cross-compiling is not fully supported by the <code>configure</code> script (such
support is a work-in-progress).
<p>
You can either use <code>base/unixansi.mak</code> or <code>unix-gcc.mak</code>
as the basis for a cross-compile makefile, or use <code>configure</code> to
create a basic <code>Makefile</code> as the basis. And modify to suit.
<p>
You can set the compiler to your cross-compiler for <code>configure</code> by doing:
<blockquote>
./configure CC=&ltcross-compiler executable&gt
</blockquote>
<p>
and <code>configure</code> will then run its checks (as best it can) with the
cross-compiler.
<p>
If you do so, you should also give <code>configure</code> the option to set the
target architecture endianness: <code>--enable-big-endian</code> or <code>--enable-little-endian</code>.
<p>
It would also be wise to review the settings shown in the output of <code>./configure --help</code> for
any that would be applicable to your target.
<br>
<br>
<p>
The Ghostscript build system uses several interim executables, built and run on the <code>host</code>,
as such, even when cross-compiling, a <code>host native</code> compiler is also required. You must edit
your <code>makefile</code> to ensure that is available. Find the line that starts:
<blockquote>
CCAUX=
</blockquote>
<p>
and set that to your <code>host compiler</code>.
<p>
If you did not use <code>configure</code> or did not set the <code>CC</code> variable for <code>configure</code>,
you must also set the:
<blockquote>
CC=
</blockquote>
<p>
to your cross-compiler.
<p>
The Ghostscript build system uses a utility called <code>genarch</code>
(see <code>base/genarch.c</code> for details) to interrogate the environment and
generate a header file describing the architecture for which Ghostscript is being
built. As this is run on the <code>host</code> it will generate header for the
<code>host architecture</code> rather than that of the <code>target</code>.
<p>
For cross compiling, you must create (or modify) a header file (<code>arch.h</code>)
which accurately describes the <code>target architecture</code>. Then you must
edit your <code>makefile</code> by finding the line:
<blockquote>
TARGET_ARCH_FILE=
</blockquote>
<p>
and set it to the path to, and file name of your custom <code>arch.h</code> file. With that
setting, <code>genarch</code> will still be run, but rather than interrogate the current environment,
it will copy the contents of your custom <code>arch.h</code> to the build.

<h2><a name="PC_build"></a>How to build Ghostscript from source (PC version)</h2>

All Ghostscript builds in PC (DOS and MS Windows) environments are 32- or
64-bit: 16-bit builds are not supported.  The relevant makefiles are

<p>
Ghostscript requires at least MS Windows 95 (although we no longer actively test nor
support Win95, we have not deliverately done anything to break compatibility with it).
We recommend at least MS Windows NT 4.0.
<p>
For building, Ghostscript requires at least Visual Studio .NET 2003, and we recommend
at least Visual Studio 2005 (required for 64 bit Windows support).
<p>
Note that the <code>make</code> program supplied with Visual Studio (and earlier
Visual C++ versions) is actually called <code>nmake</code>. We refer to this
program generically as <code>make</code> everywhere else in this document.

<p>
You must have <code>cmd.exe</code> in your path to build Ghostscript (using
the Visual Studio command prompt is ideal). After making any changes required to choose
features and devices to build into the executable, you can then invoke <code>make</code>
to build the executable.

<p><a name="Make_windows"></a>

<h3><a name="Microsoft_build"></a>Microsoft Visual Studio</h3>
<p>

<h4><a name="Using_the_MS_Development_Environment"> </a>Using Microsoft Visual Studio</h4>
<p>
The Ghostscript source distribution ships with <code>project</code> and <code>solution</code>
files for Visual Studio 2005 and later. These can be found in the <code>windows</code> directory.
The <code>project(s)</code> are <code>nmake projects</code> which means that rather than Visual
Studio controlling the build directly, it delegates the build process the the <code>nmake</code>.
<p>
Beyond lacking support for parallel builds (<code>nmake</code> cannot support parallel builds),
there should be little visible difference between a conventional VS project and an
<code>nmake project</code> to the user of the VS graphical interface. The only exception to that
is if you have to make changes to build options beyond those available in the defined build
configurations. In that case, you need to find the <code>Nmake</code> tab in the project
<code>Property Pages</code> and modify the appropriate entry: <code>Build Command Line</code>,
<code>Rebuild All Command Line</code> and/or <code>Clean Command Line</code>.
<p>
NOTE: changing the <code>Output</code> property in the <code>Nmake</code> properties will not
change the name of the executable - to do that requires editing of the <code>psi/msvc.mak</code>
makefile, or you can add: <code>GS=myname.exe</code> to the <code>nmake</code> command line.

<h4><a name="Using_the_command_line"></a>Using the command line</h4>
<p>Ghostscript can be made using the Windows command prompt or one of the various command
line shells made for Windows, as long as the command line syntax is compatible with the
Windows <code>CMD.exe</code>. The Visual Studio command prompt is ideal.

<p>In order for the makefiles to work properly, two items may have to be changed. 
  An attempt is made to select the correct version of Microsoft Visual C++
  based on the version of nmake.  If this doesn't work it will default
  to version 6.x.  
  If the auto-detection does not work, and you are not using version 6.x then before building,
  in <code>psi\msvc.mak</code> find the line &quot;<code>#MSVC_VERSION=6</code>&quot; and change it to
  &quot;<code>MSVC_VERSION=4</code>&quot;, &quot;<code>MSVC_VERSION=5</code>&quot;, &quot;<code>MSVC_VERSION=7</code>&quot;
  or &quot;<code>MSVC_VERSION=8</code>&quot; and so on. 
<p>In some cases the location of the Microsoft Developer Studio, needs to be changed. 
  The location of Microsoft Developer Studio is defined by the value of <code>DEVSTUDIO</code>. 
  There are several different definitions of <code>DEVSTUDIO</code> in psi\msvc.mak. 
  There is one for each of the currently supported versions of Microsoft Visual 
  C++ (4, 5, 6, 7, 7.1 and 8). 
<p>The normal installation process for Microsoft Visual C++ includes setting the 
  location of the Microsoft Visual C++ executables (cl.exe, link.exe, nmake.exe, 
  rc.exe) in your PATH definition and the LIB and INCLUDE environment variables 
  are set to point to the Microsoft Visual C++ directories. If this is true then 
  the value for <code>DEVSTUDIO</code> can be changed to empty. I.e. <code>DEVSTUDIO=</code>
<p> If PATH, LIB, and INCLUDE are not correctly set then the value for <code>DEVSTUDIO</code> 
  needs to be defined. For example, for version 6.0, the default definition for 
  the location for the Microsoft Developer Studio is: <code>DEVSTUDIO=C:\Program 
  Files\Microsoft Visual Studio </code> If the path to Microsoft Developer Studio 
  on your system differs from the default then change the appropriate definition 
  of <code>DEVSTUDIO</code>. (Remember that there is a separate definition 
  of <code>DEVSTUDIO</code> for each version of MSVC, so be sure to change 
  the correct definition.) 
<p>To run the <code>make</code> program, give the command 
<blockquote><code>
nmake -f psi\msvc.mak
</code></blockquote>

<p>
Rather than changing psi/msvc.mak, these values can also be specified on 
the make command line,  I.e.

<blockquote><code> nmake -f psi\msvc.mak MSVC_VERSION=6 DEVSTUDIO=&quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio&quot; <br>
nmake -f psi\msvc.mak MSVC_VERSION=7 DEVSTUDIO=&quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET&quot;
 </code></blockquote>

<p> Note that double quotes have been added around the path for <code>DEVSTUDIO</code> 
  due to the spaces in the path value.
<p>
This command line can also be put into a batch file.

<p> You may get warning messages during compilation about various undefined
and/or unsupported switches - this is because the compiler switches are set
in the makefiles, and are applied when building with all versions of Visual
Studio, but not all options are supported (or required) by all versions of
Visual Studio. These warnings are benign and can be ignored.

<h4>Building with the Luratech compression libraries</h4>

<p>
If you wish to compile Ghostscript with the Luratech JBIG2 and JPEG 2000 
implementations, the source should be installed in the top-level 
directory of the Ghostscript source.
If you have an appropriately licensed source distribution this should 
already have been done.

<p>
With the Luratech source in the <code>luratech/ldf_jb2</code> and
<code>luratech/lwf_jp2</code> directories in the top level gs source
directory, the nmake makefile will detect their presence, and use them
automatically.
<p>
If you have the Luratech code in place, but wish Ghostsrcipt to be built
without the Luratech decoders, you can do so by passing NO_LURATECH=1 on
the nmake command line, or add the define to your Visual Studio project.

<h3><a name="Microsoft_build_64"></a>Microsoft Environment for 64-bit</h3>

Building Ghostscript for 64-bit Windows (AMD64 processor) requires
Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2005 or Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 or later
on 64-bit Windows.  Cross compiling on 32-bit Windows is possible.
<p>
Compiling for 64-bit is similar to the 
<a href="#Microsoft_build">Microsoft Environment</a> instructions above,
but with the addition of a WIN64 define.

To make ghostscript use
<blockquote><code>
  nmake -f psi/msvc.mak WIN64=
</code></blockquote>

<h4><a name="Self-extracting_executables"></a>Making self-extracting installers</h4>

<p>
You can build self-extracting Windows installers based on
<code>NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)</code>. To do so, use the <code>nsis</code>
makefile taget as well as any other options, for example:
<blockquote><code>
  nmake -f psi/msvc.mak WIN64= nsis
</code></blockquote>
<p>
will create an <code>nsis</code> based installer for Ghostscript built for 64 bit Windows
systems.

<h3><a name="Microsoft_build_winrt"></a>Microsoft Environment for WinRT</h3>

<p>
Ghostscript can be built in the form of a win32 DLL for use within a Windows Runtime
application or Windows Runtime component. Building for WinRT requires use of
Microsoft Visual Studio 2012. There is a solution file that can be loaded into VS 2012,
in the directory <code>winrt</code>

<p>
The WinRT application or component should include <code>iapi.h</code> from
<code>gs/psi</code> and link with <code>gsdll32metro.lib</code> from
<code>gs/debugbin</code> or <code>gs/releasebin</code>. Also any app using
ghostscript either directly or via a component should add <code>gsdll32metro.dll</code>
as &quot;content&quot;. This inclusion of the dll is necessary so that it
will be packaged with the app. If one wishes to be able to run the debugger on
ghostscript then <code>gsdll32metro.pdb</code> should also be added as content.

<h3><a name="Cygwin32_build"></a>Cygwin32 gcc</h3>

<p>
It is possible to compile Ghostscript for MS Windows using the Cygwin32 gcc compiler,
GNU <code>make</code>, using the "configure" generated Makefile.

<p>
Information about this compiler and environment is at the Cygwin site:

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="MSys/Mingw"></a>MSys/Mingw</h3>
The configure build can be used to build Ghostscript on MSys/Mingw systems,
but with a caveat. The msys-dvlpr adds header files into the compiler's header
search paths which cause a clash, and the build will fail as a result. If you
have the msys-dvlpr package installed, and until a better solution is available
you can work around this by temporarily renaming the "\mingw\msys\1.0\include"
directory so those headers are no longer found by the compiler.

<h2><a name="Mac_build"></a>How to build Ghostscript from source (MacOS version)</h2>

<h3><a name="MacOSX"></a>MacOS X</h3>

<p>
The unix source distribution (.tar.gz) builds fine on Darwin/MacOS X,
albeit without a display device. You can generally just use the <tt>Makefile</tt>
generated by <tt>configure</tt> as your top-level makefile and get a reasonable default
build. This will allow you to use Ghostscript from the command line as a BSD-layer
tool to rasterize postscript and pdf to image files, and convert between the
high-level formats supported by Ghostscript. See the instructions for the
unix build below for details of how to customize this build.
<p>
NOTE: If you have MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/) installed, it can
"confuse" the configure script because it includes some librares which
duplicate the "system" ones. This can cause missing symbol link errors.
In order to resolve this, you can do:<code> LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib" ./configure</code>.
That will force the linker to search the default directory first, and thus pick
up the system libraries first.
<p>
It is also possible to build "universal binaries" for MacOS X, containing <tt>i386</tt>
and <tt>x86_64</tt> binaries in one file, using the <tt>Makefile</tt>
from <tt>configure</tt>. This can be achieved by using the following invokation of
<tt>configure</tt>
<blockquote>
<code>
./configure CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc" CPP="gcc -E"
</code>
</blockquote>
<p>
You can choose the combination of valid architectures (i386/x86_64/ppc) that you
require.
<p>
The separate options for <tt>CC</tt> and <tt>CPP</tt> are required because some of
the features used by <tt>configure</tt> to explore the capabilities of the preprocessor
are not compatible with having multiple <tt>-arch</tt> options.
<p>
Building a shared library on MacOS X is the same as for other Unix-like systems, the
"configure" step is done normally, and the "so" target is given to the make invocation,
thus:
<blockquote>
<code>
make so
</code>
</blockquote>
The only difference compared to other Unix-like systems is that on OS X the resulting
shared library is created with the ".dylib" file name extension, instead of the more
usual ".so".
<p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="Unix_build"></a>How to build Ghostscript from source (Unix version)</h2>

<p>
Ghostscript now ships with a build system for unix-like operating systems 
based on GNU Autoconf. In general the following should work to configure
and build Ghostscript:

<blockquote><pre>
./configure
make
</pre></blockquote>

<p>or

<blockquote><pre>
./configure
make so
</pre></blockquote>

<p>for building ghostscript as a shared library.

<p>Please report any problems with this method on your system as a bug.

<p>
On modern unix systems, <code>./configure</code>
should create a <code>Makefile</code> which works
in most scenarios. Manual tempering and editing should rarely be needed
nor recommended.

<p>
<a name="autogen_sh"></a>
Note that if you're building Ghostscript from development source out of
a repository instead of from a released source package, you should run
'<tt>./autogen.sh</tt>' instead of <tt>./configure.</tt> This script
takes all the same options that configure does.

<p>
(deprecated; see Autoconf-based method above)
For the convenience of those already familiar with Ghostscript, the old method 
based on hand-edited makefiles is still possible but no longer supported
(and in many cases, simply do not work without substantial
expert manual-editing effort). It may also be helpful in
getting Ghostscript to build on very old platforms. The rest of this section deals exclusively
with that older method and includes numerous pointers regarding legacy systems.

<p>
(deprecated; see Autoconf-based method above)
Before issuing the <code>make</code> command to build Ghostscript, you
have to make some choices, for instance
<ul>
<li>which compiler to use;
<li>what features and devices to include;
<li>whether to use system libraries for PNG and zlib;
<li>and how to handle issues for your particular platform.
</ul>

<p>
Be sure to check the sections on <a
href="#Tool_specific_issues">tool-</a>, <a
href="#OS_specific_issues">OS-</a>, and <a
href="#Hardware_specific_issues">hardware-</a>specific issues for notes
on your particular platform and compiler.  In fact, that is the
<b><em>first</em></b> place to check if you build Ghostscript and it crashes
or produces obviously incorrect results.

<h4><a name="GNU_make"></a>make tools</h4>

<p>
You require a make tool which supports separate directories for
the derived objects (such as object files, executables and dynamically created
header files) and the source files.
<p>
In general, GNU make is the recommended choice, and some features (such as the
building of the Linux/Unix shared library build ("make so") are only available
with GNU make.
<p>
Other <code>make</code> implementations are known to work, but are not guaranteed
to do so.
<p>
<u><a name="GNU_make"></a>GNU make</u>
<p>
Current versions of GNU <code>make</code> have no problems building
Ghostscript.

<h3><a name="OS_specific_issues"></a>OS-specific issues</h3>


<h4><a name="HP_RISC"></a>H-P RISC workstations</h4>

<ul>

<p>
(see Autoconf-based method above)

<li>HP-UX versions before 11.0 do not support POSIX threads.  Set
<code>SYNC=nosync</code> in the makefile before building.

<li>Ghostscript builds on H-P machines with either GNU gcc or H-P's
ANSI-capable <code>cc</code>.  The minimal, non-ANSI-capable
<code>cc</code> that shiped with some basic HPUX system does <em>not</em>
work.  If <code>cc</code> on your system doesn't accept the
<code>-Aa</code> switch, then you need to get the full
<code>cc</code> or gcc.

<li>If you use H-P's compiler, be sure you have upgraded to a recent
release.  Many bizarre symptoms have been reported trying to build
Ghostscript with older, buggier compilers, for example:
<ul>
<li>The link step fails with a message about "<code>max</code>" not being defined.
<li>The build succeeds, but the resulting executable fails to start up,
with an error message like "Initializing... Unrecoverable error: typecheck
in .registerencoding".
<li>The build succeeds, but the resulting executable produces a black
background on the first page of output.
</ul>

<li>It is reported that On HPUX 9.* you need at least compiler patch
PHSS_5723 and dld.sl patch PHSS_5734 to build Ghostscript.  (As of late
1997, those patches are long obsolete; the current patches are compiler
PHSS_10357 and dld.sl PHSS_11246.  It is unknown whether current
Ghostscript releases work with compiler/dld.sl versions older than these.)

<li>On HPUX 10.*, we don't know what combinations of compiler version and
switches work.  It is reported that On HPUX 10.20, setting
"<code>CC=c89</code>" and "<code>CFLAGS=+O3&nbsp;&#36;(XCFLAGS)</code>"
works, contradicting the information in the next paragraph, but this may be
dependent on the specific compiler version.

<li>In either HPUX version, you need to set
"<code>CC=cc&nbsp;-Aa</code>" (or use <code>-Ae</code> if you
prefer), and set
"<code>CFLAGS=-D_HPUX_SOURCE&nbsp;-O&nbsp;&#36;(XCFLAGS)</code>".  Higher
levels of optimization than <code>-O</code> may work depending on your
compiler revision; some users have reported success with
<code>+O3</code>, some have not.

<li>Some users have reported needing <code>-DNOSYSTIME</code> and
<code>-D_POSIX_SOURCE</code> in <code>CFLAGS</code>, but recent tests
do not show these to be necessary.

<li>If you use gcc, it's a good idea to have a recent release -- at the
very least 2.7.2.1 or later.You may be able to get a working
executable with an older gcc by removing <code>-O</code> from
<code>CFLAGS</code>.
</ul>

<h4><a name="RS6000"></a>IBM RS/6000 with AIX</h4>
<p>
We recommend installing gcc and GNU make, and using the Autoconf-based method.
<p>
Other combinations are known to work, but are less well supported.
<h4>
<a NAME="Silicon_Graphics"></a>Silicon Graphics</h4>
<p>
(see Autoconf-based method above)

<p>
Users have had a lot of problems with the MIPSpro compilers on SGI systems.
We recommend using gcc.  If you do choose to use the MIPSpro compiler,
please read the following carefully.

<ul>
<li>
To make the optimizer allocate enough table space, set

<p><code>CFLAGS="-Olimit 2500"</code> (for older compilers)
<br><code>CFLAGS="-OPT:Olimit=2500"</code> (for newer compilers)

<p>
MIPSpro compiler version 3.19 is "older", and 7.1 is "newer"; we aren't
sure at what point in between the latter syntax was introduced.

<li>
With the compiler shipped with Irix 5.2, use the <code>-ansi</code>
option.

<li>
The SGI C compiler may produce warnings about "Undefined the ANSI standard
library defined macro stdin/stdout/stderr". To suppress these warnings, add
"<code>-woff 608</code>" to the definition of <code>CFLAGS</code>.

<li>
The SGI C compiler shipped with Irix 6.1 and 6.2 will not compile
<code>zlib/deflate.c</code> properly with optimization. Compile this file
separately without <code>-O</code>.

<li>
With IRIX 6.5.x and the MIPSpro 7.x compilers there have been reports about
incorrect output and binaries that cause segmentation faults.&nbsp; Various
solutions have been suggested and you may want to try them in this order,
until you get a working binary:

<ul>
<li>
Compile <code>idict.c</code> and <code>isave.c</code> separately
without optimization after doing a normal compile; then relink.e.g.:

<p>
<code>cc -OPT:Olimit=2500 -I. -I./obj -o ./obj/idict.o -c ./idict.c</code><br>
<code>cc -OPT:Olimit=2500 -I. -I./obj -o ./obj/isave.o -c ./isave.c</code>

<li>
Set <code>CFLAGS=</code> (no optimization).

<li>
Use only <code>-O2</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Compiler produces incorrect output
with <code>-O3</code> or "<code>-Ofast=ip32 -show</code>".

<li>
Irix 6.5.1m with MIPSpro compiler 7.2.1.1m, Irix 6.5.3m with MIPSpro
compiler 7.2.1, and probably other 6.5x / 7.2x combinations require
compiling with the <code>-o32</code> option. Compiling with the (default)
<code>-n32</code> option produces non-working executables.
<code>-O2</code> is OK (possibly except for <code>idict.c</code>), but
not <code>-O3</code>.
</ul>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Sun"></a>Oracle/Sun</h4>
<p>
(see Autoconf-based method above)

<ul>
<li>The Sun unbundled C compiler (SC1.0) doesn't compile Ghostscript
properly with the <code>-fast</code> option: Ghostscript core-dumps in
<code>build_gs_font</code>.  With that compiler use <code>-g</code>,
or use gcc instead.

<li>The Sun version of <code>dbx</code> often gives up with an error
message when trying to load Ghostscript.  If this happens, use GNU
<code>gdb</code> instead.  (<code>gdb</code> is more reliable than
<code>dbx</code> in other ways as well.)

<li>A bug in some versions of <code>zlib</code> results in an undefined
symbol <code>zmemcmp</code> when compiling with Sun cc.  Use gcc
instead.

</ul>

<h4><a name="Solaris"></a>Solaris</h4>

<ul>
<li>Solaris 2.2 may require setting "<code>EXTRALIBS=-lsocket</code>".
Solaris 2.3 and later seem to require "<code>EXTRALIBS=-lnsl&nbsp;-lsocket&nbsp;-lposix4</code>".

<li>For Solaris 2.6 (and possibly some other versions), if you set
<code>SHARE_LIBPNG=1</code>, <code>SHARE_ZLIB=1</code>, or
<code>SHARE_JPEG=1</code>, you may need to set

<p>
<code>XLDFLAGS=-R /usr/local/</code>xxx<code>/lib:/usr/local/lib</code>

<p>
using the full path names of the relevant directories.

<li>Solaris 2.<em>n</em> uses <code>/usr/openwin/share/include</code>
for the X11 libraries rather than <code>/usr/local/X/include</code>.

<li>Solaris 2.<em>n</em> typically has Type 1 fonts in
<code>/usr/openwin/lib/X11/fonts/Type1/outline</code>.

<li>For Solaris 2.<code>n</code> in the makefile you must change
the definition of <code>INSTALL</code> from "<code>install&nbsp;-c</code>" to
"<code>/usr/ucb/install&nbsp;-c</code>".

<li>You may need to set <code>XLIBDIR</code> to the directory that holds
the X11 libraries, as for other SVR4 systems.  Set <code>-DSVR4</code>
in <code>CFLAGS</code>.

<li>If you are using the SunPRO C compiler, don't use optimization level
<code>-xO3</code>.  On SPARC platforms the compiler hangs; on Intel
platforms the generated code is incorrect.  With this compiler on Intel, do
not use the <code>-native</code> flag: floating point computations
become unacceptably inaccurate.  You can use <code>-xcg92</code> (SPARC
V8) and <code>-dalign</code> for better performance.

<li>One user reported compiling from source on a Linux NFS mounted
volume failed.  Compiling from a local volume was the workaround.

multi-threading by setting <code>SYNC=nosync</code> in the top-level
makefile.  Note that you will not be able to use any so-called "async"
drivers (drivers that overlap interpretation and rasterization) if you do
this.  No such drivers are in the <code>DEVICE_DEVS*</code> lists of any
makefile that we distribute.

<h3><a name="Plan_9"></a>Plan 9</h3>

<p>
Use <code>unix-gcc.mak</code>, editing it to define

<blockquote><code>
CC=cc
GCFLAGS=-D_BSD_EXTENSION -DPlan9
</code></blockquote>

<p>
You will also probably have to edit many path names.


<h2><a name="UFST_build"></a>How to build Ghostscript with UFST</h2>

<p>
<em>Note: This section is only for customers who have a Monotype Imaging UFST license.
Other users please skip this section.
</em>

<p>
Ghostscript sources do not include UFST sources. You need to obtain them separately.
The Ghostscript distributed source include only some source modules that provide a
bridge to UFST. You will also need an additional, UFST specific makefile: contact
Ghostscript support for more information
<p>
If optioned in, the Ghostscript build system will build the UFST as part of the normal
bulid process (previously, the UFST was required to be built separately).
<p>
To build Ghostscript with UFST, specify additional options for "make":

<dl>
<dt><code>UFST_BRIDGE=1</code>
<dd>forces the UFST bridge to build.

<dt><code>UFST_ROOT=path</code>
<dd>specifies the path to UFST root directory or folder.

<dt><code>UFST_CFLAGS=options</code>
<dd>specifies C compiler options for UFST library. Refer to UFST manual for information about them.

<dt><code>UFST_LIB_EXT=extension</code>
<dd>sets the file name extension for object libraries. You must use the appropriate one for your platform and linker.
</dl>

<p>An example for Unix/GCC :
<blockquote>
<tt>UFST_BRIDGE=1 UFST_ROOT=../ufst UFST_CFLAGS=-DGCCx86 UFST_LIB_EXT=.a</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>Starting with Ghostscript 9.x (Summer 2010), the above options are conveniently
inserted in the <code>Makefile</code> with
(this also automatically disable the freetype bridge):
<blockquote>
<tt>./configure --with-ufst=../ufst</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>For Windows/MSVC you need only specify UFST_ROOT.
msvc.mak sets the other options automatically.
