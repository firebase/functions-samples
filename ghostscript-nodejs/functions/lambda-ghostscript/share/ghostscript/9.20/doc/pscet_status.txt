                The attributes of the arrays returned by currentcolortransfer
                vary between PS interpreters. PLRM doesn't require any
                particular attributes. Initial graphic state is created by an OEM,
                not Adobe.

09-34-12  AOK	GS has smooth gradients, Tek hardcopy has dark gray stripe up

		I found that once I set embedded an sRGB colorrendering
		dictionary, which is what AD7 uses for RGB matching,
		GS and AD7 were nearly a perfect match. There was only
		one relatively small rectangle area pointed out by cmpi in a
		single ramp ( the CIEDefg [ffff] row). It appears that the TEK
		output is the one that is incorrect. TIM

		cpsi/09-34-15  missing

09-34-16  AOK	GS missing some graphics seen on Tek hardcopy. 
		Probably RGB vs. CMYK device color - RJJ.
		I do not understand Ray's comment.  Using the ppmraw device, I
		see all of the graphics at the right side of the page.  Please
		note that the appearance of this page depends upon the process
		color model of the output device.  The page uses spot colors.
		Thus the appearance of the page depends upon how the device
		treats spot colors.  One of the spot color is called C1 and it
		is white.  The C1 spot color is printed on top of the lower four
		graphics.  Thus if the output device supports spot colors then
		this results in a white appearance for this section of the page.
		The GS tiffsep device (which supports spot colors) shows this
		section of the page as being white.  The tiffsep device also
		produces a separation for the C1 spot color which shows the area
		covered by this ink.  Devices which do not support spot colors
		use the tint transform function to convert the spot colors into
		process colors.  Logically the tint tranform functions should
		produced the same appearance as the spot colors.  However this is
		not the case with this page.  Thus devices which do not support
		spot colors such as the ppmraw (process color model = DeviceRGB)
		or the tiff32nc (device process color = DeviceCMYK only) use the
		tint transform functions are producing different appearances.
		The same effect can be seen with Distiller/Acrobat 7.0.  The
		presence of the spot colors can be examined with the 'Output
		Preview' feature.  Disabling the 'Overprint Preview' changes
		the process color model of Acrobat to DeviceRGB.  This forces
		the use of the tint transform functions by Acrobat.  The
		'missing' graphics then appear.

09-34-2  AOK	GS has Yellow graphic, Tek shows Red for 'SeparateUnBlue setcolorspace'
		(right of "1.0" text). Probably RGB vs. CMYK device color
		NOTE: AD7 and Tek hardcopy output differ in same areas. - RJJ
		Distiller/Acrobat 7.0 differ on four graphics.  These are the five below
		the text that says "( /HIVAL 4095 def )".  Distiller/Acrobat shows the
		first four of these as a grayish shade.  The fifth is a paler shade of
		gray.  GS shows these as black, gray, burgandy, brown, and red respectively.
		- ADC. 
		From what I can see the yellow graphic that GS creates is
		correct. The color space is aptly named "SeparateUnblue" (see
		further below), since "un-blue" is yellow, this lead me to
		believe yellow is what should be produced. Upon further digging
		into the color space and putting some debug messages in the
		tintTransform procedure, it also seems to be correct. From what
		I can see the tint tintTransform procedure takes the blue value
		and does some math on it to vary it in the range of 0.0 to 1.0.
		It also places two ones on the stack just ahead of this blue
		value so that all values passed to the /DeviceRGB are in the
		range 1,1,0 to 1,1,1, which are various shades of yellow.
		--
		When I first did this I didn't know about the AD7 output... This
		further verifies that the yellow is correct as AD7 matches GS
		for this part of the job.
		--
		There is a second unresolved issue below the section that says
		"/HIVAL 4095 def". I believe again that the four non-matching
		graphics produced by GS are correct. For example...
		--
		The burgandy and brown are produced by the following code, respectively:
		/HIVAL 4095 def
		...
		(gs Indexed_RGB_Proc setcolorspace 2048 setcolor Q)
		(gs Indexed_RGB_Proc setcolorspace 3072 setcolor Q)
		With the following colorspace definition:
		/Indexed_RGB_Proc
		{
			[
				/Indexed
				/DeviceRGB
				HIVAL
				{
					dup
					HIVAL
					div
					exch
					HIVAL
					2
					idiv
					dup
					2
					index
					exch
					mod
					exch
					div
					exch
					HIVAL
					3
					idiv
					dup
					3
					-1
					roll
					exch
					mod
					exch
					div
				}
			]
		}
		def
		--
		Basically this space produces as output RGB values where the B's
		that are split into 3 ranges by B_out= ( Value_in mod (HIVAL/3)
		) / (HIVAL/3), G's that are split into 2 ranges by G_out =
		(Value_in mod (HIVAL/2) ) / (HIVAL/ 2) and the R's are in one
		range by R_out = Value_in / HIVAL. So a input value of 1/2 of
		the input range (determined by HIVAL) produces an output of
		roughly R=0.5, G=0, B=0.5. An input value of .75 of the input
		range produces and output of roughly R=.74,G=.5,B=.25
		--
		I modified the colorspace to dump the stack at the end of its
		number crunching tintTransform procedure. I printed out the
		values for the burgandy and brown graphic sections and here is
		what I got back.
		--
		2048 setcolor
		0.500366	// B
		0.00048852	// G
		0.500122	// R
		Which is the burgandy color mentioned.
		--
		3072 setcolor
		0.250549	// B
		0.500733	// G
		0.750183	// R
		Which is the brown color mentioned.
		This verified to me that GS is doing the right thing. TIM

09-34-3  AOK	GS RGB has missing graphic, Tek shows Cyan for 'SeparateUncyan setcolorspace'
		(right of "1.0" text). GS matches Tek if Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black
		Separation colorspaces are known, as with the 'tiffsep' device. A printer
		that is CMYK will usually have the Separations available for overprint
		effects. RJJ
		-
		NOTE: AD7 and Tek hardcopy output differ in same areas. RJJ
		GS produces output matching Tektronix if 'tiffsep' device since this
		device does not use the tint transform on /Cyan separation used in the
		SeparationUncyan section.
		-
		The 'SeparateUncyan' issue is another example of a separation color space
		which (intentionally ?) has a tint transform function which produces different
		colors when it is used.  Thus the output depends upon whether or not the tint
		transform function is used.  This can be seen by disabling the 'Overprint
		Preview' feature in Acrobat 7.0.  GS produces results which are consistent with
		Acrobat for both cases. (this is expected). ADC

                This is an obvious bug that we don't want in Ghostscript.

09-34-7  AOK	GS has different 'currentcolor' results and different color graphics
		Probably RGB vs. CMYK device color
		NOTE: AD7 and Tek hardcopy output differ in same areas. - RJJ
		There are two issues with this page.  The first issue is the colors of
		of the various graphics on the page.   The page has spot colors.  It
		also has tint transform functions which do not provide logically
		consistent results.  Thus the appearance of the graphics depend upon
		if the tint transform functions are being used.  The results with GS
		match the results from Acrobat 7.0 as expected.
		The second issue (which is a problem) is that the currentcolor value
		for the CIEBasedDEFG differs.  The graphic for the same line is also
		missing (which is probably related.) - ADC
		--
		The differences were releated to the colorrendering dictionary
		in use. When I embedded an sRGB CRD the output matched AD5/AD7. TIM

09-36-4  NF	Dash pattern differences with GS.
		Analyzed by Igor. 
                -
                GS rounds coordinates to 1/256th of a pixel.
		Due to that, when a curve is converted into a polygon,
		its vertices are rounded, and therefore the length
		of the polygon becomes few bigger than the ideal polygon.
		Then applying the dash, it covers a smaller part
		of the polygon than with CPSI.
		-
		One possible solution is :
		Add floating coordinates to path segments.
		The floating coordinates duplicate fixed ones,
		and used only for computing the segment length.
		The old fixed coordinated are used for anything else
		as they do now.

09-36-5  DIFF	In "Technical Paths", Ghostscript differs a lot, combination
		of 09-24-2 linecap linejoin issues and dash issues. Defer 
		this until after 09-24-2 is addressed.  
		Need CPSI for investigations.

		Analyzed by Igor.
		The test is buggy : insufficient stream data,
		the effect does not correspond to the comment in the test.
		Due to insufficient data GS adds zeros at end,
		and the function becomes like this :
		000000 ff000000            ff00ff ffff0000
		000000 00000000            000000 00000000
		The DeviceN maps it to DeviceRGB with dropping the last 4 components,
		so we've got corner colors :
		black     magenta
		black     black
		That's what we observe with GS.
		There is a comment in gsdsrc.c ln 47 :
		/* Access data from a string or a byte object. */
		/* Does check bounds, and returns 0 data oob. Spec calls for rangecheck,
		   but CPSI implementation silently gives (bogus) data. */
		Tek paints       black   magenta
		                 black   red       - likely an occasional data at stream end.

		Test10: aok
		Analyzed by Igor.
		A bug in the test : excessive stream data,

		Then crop with the "positive" quadrant :

		77ff77 ffffff
		It looks close to what GS paints.
		CPSI paints something like this :
		770000 ff0000

		showpage
		72 72 moveto 72 72 rlineto clip

		The test installs aclipping path from a single line.
		The first page paints a line, so
		the clipping is not empty.
		The second page first installs same clipping,
		and then applies rectclip over it.
		The intersection isn't empty by theory,
		but with CPSI it appears empty and 
		"clippath currentpoint" fails with nocurrentpoint.

11-18-6  AOK 	Adobe interpreters (CPSI, Tek, Distiller 5) have obvious

                1. The long diagonal line is caused by "clippath 0 0 rlineto
                   stroke showpage". Different Adobe interpreters draw it
                   fron the center of the page to different corners.

                   LOOK 30 and MUCH 34 cases. This bug can be demonstrated
                   by this short program "300 300 moveto 10 10 rlineto 8 8

11-19-6  AOK	cash21, look30 : ustrokepath ending point, Analyzed by Igor.
		I believe it is CPSI problem.
		I placed some tests to peeves:/home/igor/pscet/mytests/11-19-Igor01.zip .
		The ZIP contains 2 PS files, which are made from 11-19.PS
		with removing unrelated things and inserting a debug printing.
		The 2 files differ in a small thing : wheter it access
		currentpoint after ustrokepath, or not.
		The rasters (included into the ZIP) appear to be different !
		The log files (included into the ZIP) tell us that no error happen,
		because the currenpoint coordinates are successfully printed
		(in the order Y X).
		The position of the 2nd cross depends on the
		currentpoint after ustrokepath,
		but 'currentpoint' appears to cnahge it !
		I believe that CPSI actually didn't pass the "interference" test,
		which 1-19-6 is designed for.
		As we noticed from other 20 tests (unpublished), this behavior 
		appears pretty occasional, so we're unable to analyze it completely 
		and to reproduce it in Ghostscript.
		Tek matches CPSI though - I can't know why.
		Welcome anybody who can improve this analyzis.

		A simplified test is stored into peeves/home/igor/pscet/mytests/11-20-5-Igor01.ps .
		It prints the pathbbox before and after "3 3 rlineto",
		as well as the current point before and after it :

		11-20 GSTATE = 31293 Graphic 0 ms  
		.
		Note: pathbbox and currentpoint are printed in the reverse order.
		The starting and the ending point of the line appear
		within the initial pathbbox.
		In same time the lower X of pathbbox changes from 80.3225 to 39.5
		without a visible reason. With GS it doesn't change.
		Note: my copy of CPSI probably is some older,
		but it renders same 11-20-5.ppm as one on peeves.

                The problem (at least partly) is caused by a small bounding box
                set by setbbox operator that cannot accomodate long strings of text.
                Adobe appears to extend path bounding box on demand instead of
                enforcingwhen the limits when the current point comes from a
                different gstate, for instance:

11-21-10  AOK	Differences in look20, look30, look33 are caused by CPSI problem :
		rlineto, rcurveto count wrong coordinates after strokepath.
		It looks as the starting point for relative coordinate is not equal to
		the current point. CPSI paints a self-intersecting curve with
		"9 0 9 -9 0 -9 rcurveto stroke", which must not self-intersect.

		2. setflat - same as 09-09-1.
		3. CPSI doesn't roll a dash pattern at some corners.
		An example is at the lower right corner of the page.
		The dash at one corner looks longer than the distance to the corner.
		IMO it's another CPSI bug.

		CPSI doesn't follow PLRM page 199 about user paths :
                "the first operator after setbbox must be an absolute positioning operator 
                (moveto, arc, or arcn)." 
                "All coordinates specified as operands must fall within the bounds 
                specified by setbbox".
                When an user path starts with rmoveto, CPSI looks using current point 
                from the graphic state when it is set, and probably the setbbox lower coordinates
                when current point is not set. However arc, arcn in the user path
                do not paint a line from the graphic state current point.
                Also painting outside setbbox somethimes throws error, sometimes not -
                we could not figure out what does it depend on.
                Due to all that CPSI's algorithm isn't clear and we're unable to reproduce it.
                Will follow PLRM instead.

                Partial analysis from Jan (11/29/2006)
                1. An uncolored pattern is created, and used to draw the region on       
                   the left.  The pattern consists of a 9 unit x 9 unit tile, in the     
                   center of which is a 7 unit x 7 unit colored square.  The pattern     
                   receives its color at the time the setpattern operator is invoked.    
                   For this test, that color is black.                                   
                --                                                                         
                2. Next, a colored pattern is created, and used to draw the figure       
                   on the right.  This pattern also consists of a 9 unit x 9 unit tile,  
                   whose PaintProc operates as follows:                                  
                     - create a path consisting of a 5 unit x 5 unit square centered     
                       in the 9 unit x 9 unit tile                                       
                     - save graphic state                                                
                     - set an approximately magenta color and fill the square            
                     - restore the graphic state                                         
                     - outline the same square with an approximately 4 unit wide line;   
                       this line obscures all but a 1/2 unit x 1/2 unit square of the    
                       magenta region                                                    
                   The key step is the last one, because the PaintProc does not set a    
                   color for drawing the line.  In this case it inherits the color       
                   from the graphic state in effect when the makepattern operator was    
                   invoked, which is the uncolored pattern created in Step (1).          
                --                                                                         
                3. Ghostscript renders the uncolored pattern into a gx_color_tile        
                   structure when drawing the left region, and caches that strcuture.    
                   When the second region is to be rendered, another gx_color_tile       
                   is created, and the cached tile of the uncolored pattern is used      
                   (in part) to render this new tile.  The caching accumulator           
                   device is used for this purpose.                                      
                --                                                                         
                4. The problem arises because the cached gx_color_tile for the           
                   uncolored pattern has its phase information set for the original      
                   device, not the accumulator device being used to create the tile      
                   for the colored pattern.                                              
                   --                                                                      
                   As we noted earlier, Ghostscript renders patterns to                  
                   gx_color_tile structures of minimum size.  Such a mechanism           
                   cannot handle the general case in which one pattern makes use of      
                   another pattern.  Either the tile size must be increased to the       
                   least common multiple of the patterns' step sizes, or some more       
                   elaborate compositing technique must be used for final rendering.     
                   --                                                                      
                   However, in this case both patterns have the same step sizes (and     
                   the same tile size), so Ghostscript should be able to handle the      
                   situation correctly.  We thought the problem was that the             
                   uncolored pattern was already cached, and so we modified the code     
                   to discard cached patterns just before executing a pattern            
                   PaintProc.  That resolves the phase issue, but the "inner"            
                   pattern (the uncolored pattern in this case) is rendered using        
                   the wrong transformation matrix.  We haven't yet had time to go       
                   back and determine why this is happening.

		GS problem with non-contigous function.
		A fix is possible but isn't simple.
		A suggestion was posted to 'teco' on November 8
		and then dismissed. Now it arises anew.
		.
		First we need gs_function_evaluate to return a new bit.
		which tells that the function has a discontinuty at
		the point. Fortunately poly-argument PS finctions are
		always contigous (otherwise the topology of discontinuty
		would be a hell).
		.
		There are 20 calls to patch_interpolate_color,
		which deal with it. It must return a bit,
		which tells whether the function
		isn't contiguous at the point.
		If so, it must be called at second 
		time for computing another limit to this point.
		.
		The change should look like this :
		.
		+ typedef enum {left, right} function_limit_direction;
		.
		  { 
		- patch_color_t c;
		+ patch_color_t *C;
		+ function_limit_direction discontinuty;
		-  patch_interpolate_color(&c, c0, c1, pfs, 0.5);
		+  discontinuty = patch_interpolate_color(&c, c0, c1, pfs, 0.5, left);
		+   if (discontinuty) 
		+      patch_interpolate_color(&C, c0, c1, pfs, 0.5, right);
		+   else 
		+       C = &c;
		  // Then a half of occurances 'c' to be replaced with 'C'.
		  }

		The data are interpreter like this :
		000000ff000000 ff00ffffffxxxx
		xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
		where x is an insufficient data. GS pads it with zeros,
		CPSI is indeterministic.
		After tintTransform we get CMYK colors :
		000000ff ff00ffff       
		xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx       
		GS should paint :      black     black*green
		                       white     white
		It's what we observe.
		CPSI appears wrong.

		Test07:
		Analyzed by Igor.
		The test looks buggy : duplicate DataSource.
		CPSI uses the first DataSource (padded with zeros at end), 
		and GS uses the second one while constructing the shading dictionary.
		GS interpretes the stream like this :
		000000ff 000000ff 
		00ffffff 00000000
		so the shading is not completely black - it is 1/256 gray in one corner.
		Note : lib/gs_*.ps files assume the usage of the last definition.
		I recall that at least gs_ttf.ps depends on that.
		Passing to Ray to decide what to do with it.
		assign: Ray.
		-
		Test08: aok - CPSI ingores Encode.
		It maps a haff of shading Domain outside (to negative values)
		of the function domain, so that shading must look constant at
		the riht half. That's what we see with GS.
		-
		Test09, 10, 11, 12: aok, same as Test07 except a different Encode.
		Note : the vertical 'spike' in Test10 is a false human visual effect.

12-14R-4  AOK	Test1: aok - A worse smoothing with CPSI.
		-
		Test12: aok : 
		The function itself :
		         000000 0000ff        black   blue
                         ff0000 00ff00        red     green
                         ff00ff 00ff00        magenta green 
                         ffff00 ffffff        yellow  white
                It is linear, but the green component has Decode 0 3,
                so it maps outside the color domain and 
                therefore it is cropped by the max color value 1.
                Due to the color croppig it has a plattue
                around the point where the green peak would apper.
                Then the function domain is cropped 
                with 300/400 = 0.75 by X
                and  500/600 = 0.83 by Y.
                Therefore we don't see yellow and white.
                GS paint it fine.
                CPSI has a bad smoothing and a linear gradient instead the plattue.

14-12-3  AOK	A glyph positioning difference. 
		Analyzed by Igor.
		I believe it is CPSI problem.
		A simplified test is placed to 
		peeves:/home/igor/pscet/mytests/14-12-3-Igor01.PS 
		With this test CPSI prints :
		.
		aaaa1:
		Helvetica
		has WMode
		def:/Helvetica-Oblique
		1
		defined:1
		aaaa2:
		Helvetica
		nas no WMode
		.
		Thus the redefinition of the font Helvetica
		is dropped when Helvetica-Oblique is redefined.
		It is an incorrect behavior.
		Due to that the cshow procedure prints 
		currentfont /WMode like this :
		[1 1 /U /U /U /U 1 1 0 0 0 0] 
		The right result must be :
		[1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0]
		Using the wrong WMode, glyph placements
		are wrong with CPSI.
		Tek paints something different,
		which is closer to Ghostscript,
		but looks wrong again.
		.
		Some tips for those who wants to analyze it :
		1. Font_Dict is a FMap 2 font with 8 descendents :
		1.0. Times-Roman
		1.1. Type3WMode0  (paints rectangles with size depending on char code);
		1.2. Type3WMode1  (same as above but with WMode 1)
		1.3. Type0Font1 2 scalefont - the test doesn't use it.
		1.4. FMAP2 - a FMap 2 font [ Helvetica, Helvetica-Bold, Helvetica-Oblique, Helvetica-BoldOblique]
		1.5. FMAP4 [Symbol, Symbol 2 scalefont] - the test doesn't use it.
		1.6. FMAP5 [Courier, , , ]  - the test doesn't use it.
		1.7. FMap6 [Helvetica, ...]  - the test doesn't use it.
		2. All 1st level descendent fonts above has WMode = DescendentWMode = 1
		3. Helvetica, Helvetica-Bold, Helvetica-Oblique, Helvetica-BoldOblique
		   are built into the font above aftyer redefinition with find&mod,
		   which changes WMode like this :
		   Helvetica WMode 1 
		   Helvetica-Bold WMode 0
		   Helvetica-Oblique WMode 1
		   Helvetica-BoldOblique WMode 0
		4. The text string is decomposed like this :
		   2A 2a 40A 40a 41A 41a 42A 42a 43A 43a 1A 1A
		   The 1st byte selects the 1st level descendent,
		   then it tripples the 2nd byte selects the 2nd level descendent.
		5. We believe that WMode of the leaf font only have sence.

                affected by rounding errors. When the point is inside the path,
                a small black circle is drawn around the point. The test is
                performed for different CTM.
                -
		Ghostscript skips some of the points at low resolution but

                pattern differs in 4th column of stars in the last box.

                See also 12-01-5.
                A simplified test case is placed to
                peeves:/home/igor/pscet/mytests/18-02G-1-Igor01.PS .
                This is a general pattern implementation problem.
                The test defines a pattern with TESTPROC,
                and then applyes this pattern for creating another pattern 
                Inf71ColorPattern. Doing the 2nd step, Ghostscript 
                instantiates the 1st pattern in the 2nd pattern's space.
                Contrary to that, CPSI instantiates the 1st pattern
                in the device space when instantiating the 2st pattern.
                Thus the overall pattern period with CPSI is a multiple
                of periods of the 1st and the 2nd patterns.
                This problem may be fixed for Ghostscript
                with implementing high level patterns for
                clist and raster devices.
                It would be a significant development,
                which we currently have no time for.
                Passing to Ray for schedulling.

                from the Adobe interpreters: we and Adobe have different implementation-specific
                (non-PLRM) entries, and the PLRM-documented procedures (FindResource, etc.)
                are different.  This is inherently implementation-dependent and does not
                affect any real program, so no further changes are needed. (Peter)

                -
                The two invalidaccess diffs occur because the reference implementation does
                not allow PostScript programs to open files for writing.  This is not a gs
                bug, but it does suggest that gs should provide some way to indicate/detect
                that it is running in an embedded environment with no (writable) filesystem.
                Does this exist already?
                -
                The remaining 3 diffs occur because gs implements %null as a special file
                name and the reference implementation apparently doesn't, per a previous
                e-mail.

23-12A-3  AOK   The discrepancies are in the length of the encoded
                string produced by the ASCII85Encode and
                RunLengthEncode filter respectively.  These filters
                have some discretion in their output -- ASCII85Encode
                must insert a \n at least every 80 characters, but may
                insert one more often, and RunLengthEncode is not
                required to produce maximum-length runs -- and it
                appears that gs's implementation of these filters
                produces output that is 1 byte shorter than Adobe's in
                some cases.  gs's output is (also) correct -- the CET
                verifies it by decoding it and comparing against the

                al.  In this case, gs's implementation is slightly
                inferior to Adobe's (about 6% larger compressed data
                in the worst case on the CET page), probably because
                in the mixed 1- and 2-D case, we don't bother to
                compress each line both ways and use whichever method

27-03-2  AOK	test unreasonable:
                This page enumerates all the IODevices, arbitrarily selects the last one,
                and then runs the GIF test, checking whether the currentdevparams values for
                that IODevice change as a result of running the test procedures.  This is
                dependent both on the set of IODevices (which is implementation-dependent,
                although gs could be expected to include at least the non-hardware-dependent
                ones documented in the PLRM3, which I believe it does) and the order in
                which they are enumerated by /IODevice resourceforall (which is totally
                implementation-dependent).
                -
                It appears that in the reference output, the last-enumerated IODevice is one
                whose devparams values change somewhat unpredictably -- probably %Calendar%.
                In the gs output, it's one whose devparams values don't change -- i.e. any
                of the others! (peter)
