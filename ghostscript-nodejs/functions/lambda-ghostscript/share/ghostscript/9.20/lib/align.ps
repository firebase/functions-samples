Let the distance in inches from the left edge of the page to
the vertical line be H, and from the bottom edge to the
horizontal line be V; let the lengths of the gaps at the top
and bottom of the vertical line be T and B respectively, and
the gaps at the left and right of the horizontal line be L
and R.  For correct alignment of pages, put the following line
in a file named (for example) margins.ps, and then mention
margins.ps on the gs command line when printing any of your
own files:

    <<  /.HWMargins [ml mb mr mt] /Margins [x y]  >>  setpagedevice

where
        ml = L * 72, mb = B * 72, mr = R * 72, mt = T * 72,
