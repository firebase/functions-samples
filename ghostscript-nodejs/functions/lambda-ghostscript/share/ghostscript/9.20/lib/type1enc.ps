% <state> <fromString> <toString> .type1encrypt <newState> <toSubstring>
%	Encrypts fromString according to the algorithm for Adobe
%	  Type 1 fonts, writing the result into toString.
%	  toString must be at least as long as fromString or a
%	  rangecheck error occurs.  state is the initial state of
%	  the encryption algorithm (a 16-bit non-negative
%	  integer); newState is the new state of the algorithm.

%	Decrypts fromString according to the algorithm for Adobe
%	  Type 1 fonts, writing the result into toString.  Other
