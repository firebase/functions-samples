# Crashlytics Slack Notifier

Identify important conversion workflows in your app, so that when a new issue is reported in that workflow via Crashlytics, a slack notification will be sent to a specific channel on Slack. This will allow you to react quicker to crashes that impact important conversion workflows of your app.

Crashlytics is a crash reporter for Firebase. 

Note: This assumes that you have Crashlytics in Firebase. [Learn more about Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/)


## Setting up the sample

 Create and setup the Firebase project:
  1. Create a Firebase project using the [Firebase Developer Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
  1. Enable Billing on your Firebase project by switching to the **Blaze** plan, this is currently needed to be able to perform HTTP requests to external services from a Cloud Function.
  1. Include [Crashlytics in your project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/get-started).

 Configuring the sample
  1. Clone or download this repo and open the `crashlytics-integration/slack-notifier` directory.
  1. You must have the Firebase CLI installed. If you don't have it, install it with `npm install -g firebase-tools` and then configure it with `firebase login`.
  1. Configure the CLI locally by using `firebase use --add` and select your project in the list.
  1. Install `npm` dependencies in the functions directory locally, by running: `cd functions; npm install;`
  
 Setting up an Incoming Slack Webhook
  1. Set up an [incoming webhook integration](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/) in your Slack team. Take note of the **Webhook URL**.
  1. Config and set the environment variable for the webhook URL: `firebase functions:config:set slack.webhook_url="https://hooks.slack.com/services/...` 

   
## Deploy and test

 1. Deploy your project using `firebase deploy`
 1. Simulate a test crash. [Instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/force-a-crash)
