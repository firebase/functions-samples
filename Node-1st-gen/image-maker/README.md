# Image Maker

This sample shows how to create various images through Functions and serve it to the client

It uses [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) to create a canvas environment on Node. That canvas is then used to create either a clock, sparkline chart, or sphere(s) in png format. The images are then cached on the server and sent to the client in `image/png` format.

## Setting up the sample

1.  Create a Firebase Project using the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
1.  Clone or download this repo and open the `image-maker` directory.
1.  You must have the Firebase CLI installed. If you don't have it install it with `npm install -g firebase-tools` and then configure it with `firebase login`.
1.  Configure the CLI locally by using `firebase use --add` and select your project in the list.
1.  Install dependencies locally by running: `cd functions; npm install;`

## Deploy and test

This sample comes with a web-based UI for testing the function.
To test locally do:

1.  Start serving your project locally using `firebase serve --only hosting,functions`
1.  Open the app in a browser at `https://localhost:5000`.

To deploy and test on prod do:

1.  Deploy your project using `firebase deploy`
1.  Open the app using `firebase open hosting:site`, this will open a browser.
