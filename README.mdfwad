# Cloud Functions for Firebase Sample Library

This repository contains a collection of samples showcasing some typical uses of [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/features/functions).

Samples are available for the **Node** (2nd gen), **Python** (2nd gen), and Node (1st gen). 

> Note: Python support in Cloud Functions for Firebase is a public preview. This means that the functionality might change in backward-incompatible ways. A preview release is not subject to any SLA or deprecation policy and may receive limited or no support.

### What's Cloud Functions for Firebase?

Cloud Functions is a hosted, private, and scalable Node.js environment where you can run JavaScript or Python code. [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/features/functions) integrates the Firebase platform by letting you write code that responds to events and invokes functionality exposed by other Firebase features.

## Prerequisites

> All samples require the Blaze pay-as-you-go billing plan to deploy. Learn more about [pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing#cloud-functions).

To learn how to get started with Cloud Functions for Firebase by having a look at the [Getting Started Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started), trying the [quickstart samples](/Node/quickstarts) and looking at [the documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions).
