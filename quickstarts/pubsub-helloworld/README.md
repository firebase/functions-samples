# Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions Quickstart - PubSub trigger

This quickstart demonstrates how to setup a PubSub triggered Cloud Function using the **Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions**.


## Introduction

We'll deploy a PubSub triggered Functions that prints out a Hello World message to the Cloud Logs.

## Initial setup, build tools and dependencies

### 1. Clone this repo

Clone or download this repo and open the `quickstarts/pubsub-helloworld` directory.


### 2. Create a Firebase project and configure the quickstart

Create a Firebase Project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).

Set up your Firebase project by running `firebase use --add`, select your Project ID and follow the instructions.


### 3. Install the Firebase CLI and enable Functions on your Firebase CLI

You need to have installed the Firebase CLI. If you haven't run:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

> Doesn't work? You may need to [change npm permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).


## Deploy the app to prod

First you need to install the `npm` dependencies of the functions:

```bash
cd functions && npm install; cd ..
```

This installs locally the Firebase Admin SDK and the Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions.

Deploy to Firebase using the following command:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

This deploys and activate the PubSub hello World Functions.

> The first time you call `firebase deploy` on a new project with Functions will take longer than usual.


## Try the sample

Once deployed, to try the sample use the `gcloud` CLI to publish a message to the `topic-name` topic:

```
gcloud alpha pubsub topics publish topic-name 'YourName'
```

Open the Functions logs in the Firebase Console, you should see a messages that reads "Hello YourName".

Then you can also publish a message to the `another-topic-name` topic using JSON data:

```
gcloud alpha pubsub topics publish another-topic-name '{"name":"YourName"}'
```

Open the Functions logs in the Firebase Console, you should see a messages that reads "Hello YourName".

Last you can also publish a message to the `yet-another-topic-name` topic using JSON data:

```
gcloud alpha pubsub topics publish yet-another-topic-name --attribute name=YourName
```

Open the Functions logs in the Firebase Console, you should see a messages that reads "Hello YourName".
